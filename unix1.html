<h1>UNIX Tutorial One </h1>

<h2>1.1 Listing files and directories </h2>
<h3>ls (list) </h3>
<p> When you first login, your current working directory is called your "home" directory
  and it is where your personal files and subdirectories are saved. In most Linux systems, 
 this would look like <samp>/home/jobartucz</samp> (but replace it with your personal username 
 (probably not jobartucz)). On the system we are using, for this class your username is probably
 <samp>iti</samp> (unless you did something different when setting up) so the home directory is <samp>/home/iti</samp>.</p>
<p>We are going to store all of our files in a directory called <samp>unixstuff</samp> that we
 will create.</p>
<p> To make sure you are in the correct directory, use the "cd" command to "change directory". The ~ (or "tilda") is a shortcut for "my home directory". In your terminal, type </p>
<p class="command">% cd ~ </p>
<img src="pics/a.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<p> To find out what is in your home directory, use the "ls" command to list files. In your terminal, type </p>
<p class="command">% ls </p>
<img src="pics/b.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<p>The <samp>ls</samp> command lists the contents of your current working directory. 
</p>
<p>There are probably a few files listed, which may or may not be the same as the picture above</p>
<p><samp>ls</samp> does not, in fact, cause all the files in your home directory 
  to be listed, but only those ones whose name does not begin with a dot (.) Files 
  beginning with a dot (.) are known as hidden files and usually contain important 
  program configuration information. They are hidden because you should not change 
  them unless you are very familiar with UNIX!!! </p>
<p> To list all files in your home directory including those whose names begin 
  with a dot, type </p>
<p class="command">% ls -a</p>
<img src="pics/c.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<p>This shows that there are a lot of "hidden" files and folders that you only see when you force the <samp>ls</samp>
command to show ALL files by using <samp>ls -a</samp></p>
<p> <samp>ls</samp> is an example of a command which can take options: <samp>-a</samp> 
  is an example of an option. The options change the behaviour of the command. 
  There are online manual pages that tell you which options a particular command 
  can take, and how each option modifies the behaviour of the command. (See later 
  in this tutorial) </p>
<h2>1.2 Making Directories </h2>
  
<h3>mkdir (make directory) </h3>
<p> We will now make a subdirectory in your home directory to hold the files you 
  will be creating and using in the course of this tutorial. To make a subdirectory 
  called <samp>unixstuff</samp> in your current working directory type </p>
<p class="command">% mkdir unixstuff </p>
<img src="pics/d.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<p>The command will NOT return anything at all if it is successful. If there's
an error, ask Mr. Bartucz for help!</p>
<p> To see the directory you have just created, type </p>
<p class="command">% ls </p>
<img src="pics/e.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<p>You should see your new directory, congratulations!!!</p>
<h2>1.3 Changing to a different directory&nbsp;</h2>
    
<h3>cd (change directory)</h3>
<p> The command <samp>cd <var>directory</var></samp> means change the current 
  working directory to 'directory'. The current working directory may be thought 
  of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the file-system 
  tree. </p>
<p> To change to the directory you have just made, type </p>
<p class="command">% cd unixstuff </p>
<p> Type <code>ls</code> to see the contents (which should be empty, so it will not print anything) </p>
<img src="pics/f.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<h3>Exercise 1a</h3>
<p>Make another directory inside the <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory called 
  <strong>backups</strong> </p>
<p>When you have created the directory inside unixstuff, take a screenshot and paste it into 
the assignment in Google Classroom</p>
<h2>1.4 The directories . and .. </h2>
<p> Still in the <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory, type </p>
<p class="command"> % ls -a </p>
<img src="pics/g.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<p> As you can see, in the <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory (and in all other 
  directories), there are two special directories called (<strong>.</strong>) 
  and (<strong>..</strong>)</p>
<p> In UNIX, (<strong>.</strong>) means the current directory, so typing </p>
<p class="command"> % cd . </p>
<p class="hint">NOTE: there is a space between cd and the dot</p>
<p> means stay where you are (the <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory). </p>
<p>This may not seem very useful at first, but using (<strong>.</strong>) as the 
  name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later 
  in the tutorial. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> (<strong>..</strong>) means the parent of the current directory, so typing 
</p>
<p class="command"> % cd .. </p>
<p> will take you one directory up the hierarchy (back to your home directory). 
  Try it now. </p>
<p> Note: typing <samp>cd</samp> with no argument always returns you to your home 
  directory. This is very useful if you are lost in the file system. </p>
<h2>1.5 Pathnames </h2>
<h3>pwd (print working directory) </h3>
<p> Pathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole file-system. 
  For example, to find out the absolute pathname of <samp>unixstuff</samp>
  just make sure you are still in that directory and then type </p>
<p class="command"> % pwd </p>
<p> The full pathname will look something like this - </p>
<p> <strong>/home/iti/unixstuff</strong></p>
<img src="pics/h.PNG" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-left:100px">
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Exercise 1b</h3>
<p>Use the commands <samp>ls</samp>, <samp>pwd</samp> and <samp>cd</samp> to explore 
  the file system. You can't break anything so try whatever you can think of.</p>
<p> (Remember, if you get lost, type <samp>cd ~</samp> by itself to return to your 
  home-directory) </p>
<h2>1.6 More about home directories and pathnames </h2>
<h3>Understanding pathnames</h3>
<p>First type <samp>cd ~</samp> to get back to your home-directory, then type</p>
<p class="command"> % ls unixstuff</p>
<p>to list the conents of your unixstuff directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now type </p>
<p class="command"> % ls backups</p>
<p> You will get a message like this - </p>
<p class="stdout"> backups: No such file or directory </p>
<p> The reason is, <strong>backups</strong> is not in your current working directory. 
  To use a command on a file (or directory) not in the current working directory 
  (the directory you are currently in), you must either <samp>cd</samp> to the 
  correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your 
  backups directory, you must type </p>
<p class="command"> % ls unixstuff/backups </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>~ (your home directory) </h3>
<p>Home directories can also be referred to by the tilde <strong>~</strong> character. 
  It can be used to specify paths starting at your home directory. So typing </p>
<p class="command"> % ls ~/unixstuff</p>
<p> will list the contents of your unixstuff directory, no matter where you currently 
  are in the file system. </p>
<p> What do you think </p>
<p class="command"> % ls ~</p>
<p> would list? </p>
<p> What do you think </p>
<p class="command"> % ls ~/.. </p>
<p> would list? </p>
