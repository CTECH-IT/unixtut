  <h1>UNIX Tutorial Two </h1>
  <h2>2.1 Copying Files</h2>
  <h3>cp (copy)</h3>
  <p> <samp>cp <var>file1 file2</var></samp> is the command which makes a copy of
    <strong>file1</strong> in the current working directory and calls it <strong>file2</strong>
  </p>
  <p> The copy command needs to know the file you want to copy and the destination where you want it.</p>
  <p> What we are going to do now, is to take a file stored in an open access area
    of the file system, and use the <samp>cp</samp> command to copy it to your unixstuff
    directory. </p>
  <p> First, <samp>cd</samp> to your unixstuff directory.</p>
  <p class="command"> % cd ~/unixstuff</p>
  <p> Then at the UNIX prompt, type, </p>
  <p class="command"> % cp ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs . </p>
  <p> (Note: Don't forget the dot (<samp>.</samp>) at the end. Remember, in UNIX,
    the dot means the current directory.) </p>
  <p> The above command means copy the file <strong>user-dirs.dirs</strong> to the
    current directory, keeping the name the same. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Exercise 2a</h3>
  <p>Create a backup of your <strong>user-dirs.dirs</strong> file by copying it to
    a file called <strong>user-dirs.bak</strong> </p>
  <h2>2.2 Moving files</h2>
  <h3>mv (move)</h3>
  <p><samp>mv <var>file1 file2</var></samp> moves (or renames) <strong>file1</strong>
    to <strong>file2</strong> </p>
  <p> To move a file from one place to another, use the <samp>mv</samp> command.
    This has the effect of moving rather than copying the file, so you end up with
    only one file rather than two. </p>
  <p> It can also be used to rename a file, by moving the file to the same directory,
    but giving it a different name. </p>
  <p> We are now going to move the file README.bak to your backup directory. </p>
  <p>First, change directories to your unixstuff directory (can you remember how?).
    Then, inside the <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory, type</p>
  <p class="command"> % mv README.bak backups/.</p>
  <p> Type <code>ls</code> and <code>ls backups</code> to see if it has worked.
  </p>
  <h2>2.3 Removing files and directories </h2>
  <h3>rm (remove), rmdir (remove directory)</h3>
  <p>To delete (remove) a file, use the <samp>rm</samp> command. As an example,
    we are going to create a copy of the <strong>README.md</strong> file then
    delete it. </p>
  <p> Inside your <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory, type</p>
  <p class="command"> % cp README.md tempfile.md<br />
    % ls (to check if it has created the file)<br />
    % rm tempfile.md <br />
    % ls (to check if it has deleted the file) </p>
  <p> You can use the <samp>rmdir</samp> command to remove a directory (make sure
    it is empty first). Try to remove the <strong>backups</strong> directory. You
    will not be able to since UNIX will not let you remove a non-empty directory.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Exercise 2b</h3>
  <p>Create a directory called <strong>tempstuff</strong> using <samp>mkdir</samp>
    , then remove it using the <samp>rmdir</samp> command.</p>
  <h2>2.4 Displaying the contents of a file on the screen </h2>
  <h3>clear (clear screen)</h3>
  <p>Before you start the next section, you may like to clear the terminal window
    of the previous commands so the output of the following commands can be clearly
    understood. </p>
  <p> At the prompt, type </p>
  <p class="command"> % clear </p>
  <p> This will clear all text and leave you with the % prompt at the top of the
    window. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>cat (concatenate)</h3>
  <p>The command <samp>cat</samp> can be used to display the contents of a file
    on the screen. Type: </p>
  <p class="command"> % cat README.md </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>head</h3>
  <p>The <samp>head</samp> command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen.
  </p>
  <p> First clear the screen then type </p>
  <p class="command"> % head README.md </p>
  <p> Then type </p>
  <p class="command"> % head -5 README.md </p>
  <p> What difference did the -5 do to the head command? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>tail</h3>
  <p>The <samp>tail</samp> command writes the last ten lines of a file to the screen.
  </p>
  <p> Clear the screen and type </p>
  <p class="command"> % tail README.md </p>
  <h3>Exercise 2c</h3>
  <p> Copy the file <samp>/usr/share/dict/words</samp> into your <samp>/home/ec2-user/environment/unixstuff</samp>
    directory and <samp>tail</samp> the last 15 lines </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>2.5 Searching the contents of a file </h2>
  <h3>Simple searching using less</h3>
  <p>You MUST have copied the file "words" as specified in exercise 2c to continue here</p>
  <p>Using <samp>less</samp>, you can search though a text file for a keyword (pattern).
    For example, to search through the <strong>words</strong> file that you just copied
    for the word "john" type </p>
  <p class="command"> % less words </p>
  <p> then, still in <samp>less</samp> (i.e. don't press [q] to quit), type a forward
    slash <code>[/]</code> followed by the word to search</p>
  <p class="command"> /john</p>
  <p> As you can see, <samp>less</samp> finds and highlights the keyword. Type <code>[n]</code>
    to search for the next occurrence of the word. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>grep (don't ask why it is called grep)</h3>
  <p><samp>grep</samp> is one of many standard UNIX utilities. It searches files
    for specified words or patterns. First clear the screen, then type </p>
  <p class="command"> % grep john README.md </p>
  <p> As you can see, <samp>grep</samp> has printed out each line containg the word
    john. </p>
  <p> Or has it???? </p>
  <p> Try typing </p>
  <p class="command"> % grep John words </p>
  <p> You'll notice that the lists are different. The <samp>grep</samp> command is case sensitive; it distinguishes
    between
    john, John, and JOHN. </p>
  <p> To ignore upper/lower case distinctions, use the -i option, i.e. type </p>
  <p class="command"> % grep -i john words </p>
  <p>You'll notice that the second command (with the i-) finds both "john" and "John"</p>
  <p> To search for a phrase or pattern, you must enclose it in single quotes (the
    apostrophe symbol). For example to search for the phrase "Hi there", type </p>
  <p class="command"> % grep -i 'Hi there' README.md </p>
  <p> Some of the other options of grep are: </p>
  <p> -v display those lines that do NOT match <br />
    -n precede each maching line with the line number <br />
    -c print only the total count of matched lines <br />
  </p>
  <h3>Exercise 2d</h3>
  <p> Try some of them and see the different results. Don't forget, you can use
    more than one option at a time, for example, the number of lines without the
    words welcome or Welcome is</p>
  <p class="command"> % grep -ivc welcome README.md </p>
  <p>Why do you think it prints the number 13? Does that make sense to you?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>wc (word count)</h3>
  <p>A handy little utility is the <samp>wc</samp> command, short for word count.
    To do a word count on <strong>README.md</strong>, type </p>
  <p class="command"> % wc -w README.md </p>
  <p> To find out how many lines the file has, type </p>
  <p class="command"> % wc -l README.md </p>
