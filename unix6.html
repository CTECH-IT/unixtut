<h1>UNIX Tutorial Six </h1>
<h2>Other useful UNIX commands &nbsp; </h2>

<h3>df</h3>
<p>The df command reports on the space left on the file system. For example, to 
  find out how much space is left on the fileserver, type </p>

<p class="command"> % df . </p>

<h3>du</h3>
<p>The du command outputs the number of kilobyes used by each subdirectory. Useful 
  if you have gone over quota and you want to find out which directory has the 
  most files. In your home-directory, type </p>

<p class="command"> % du /home/ec2-user/environment</p>

<h3>gzip</h3>
<p>gzip reduces the size of a file, thus freeing valuable disk space. For example, 
  type </p>

<p class="command"> % cd /home/ec2-user/environment/unixstuff </p>
<p class="command"> % ls -l words </p>
<p>if you don't see the <samp>words</samp> file there, make sure you have copied it
 as specified in tutorial 2</p>
<p>Note the size of the <samp>words</samp>file. Then to compress it, type </p>

<p class="command"> % gzip words </p>
<p>This will compress the file and place it in a file called words.gz </p>
<p> To see the change in size, type ls -l again. </p>
<p> To uncomress the file, use the gunzip command. </p>

<p class="command"> % gunzip words.gz </p>

<h3>file</h3>
<p>file classifies the named files according to the type of data they contain, 
  for example ascii (text), pictures, compressed data, etc.. To report on all 
  files in your home directory, type </p>

<p class="command"> % file * </p>

<h3>find</h3>
<p>find helps you locate a file somewhere in the folder structure.
  It is very powerful and can take many different arguments (try "man find" to 
  see them all). Usually, you give it the place you want to start searching and
  the name you are looking for:</p>

<p class="command"> % find . -name somefile </p>

<p>Remember, you can also use "wildcards" like * and ?</p>

<p class="command"> % find . -name some* </p>
<p class="command"> % find . -name s?me?ile </p>

<p>An example for us would be trying to remember where you put README.bak</a>

<p class="command"> % cd /home/ec2-user/environment/ </p>
<p class="command"> % find . -name README.bak </p>

<p> Where did it find it? If it didn't, ask Mr. B for help</p>

<h3>history</h3>
<p>The bash shell keeps an ordered list of all the commands that you have entered. 
  Each command is given a number according to the order it was entered.</p>

<p class="command"> % history (show command history list)</p>
<p>Since we are using the bash shell, we can use the exclamation character (!) to 
  recall commands easily.</p>

<p class="command">% !! (recall last command)</p>
<p class="command">% !-3 (recall third most recent command) </p>
<p class="command">% !5 (recall 5th command in list) </p>
<p class="command">% !grep (recall last command starting with grep) </p>
<p>You can increase the size of the history buffer by typing</p>

<p class="command">% HISTSIZE=1000 </p>
